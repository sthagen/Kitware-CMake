CMake Error at TARGET_INTERMEDIATE_DIR\.cmake:[0-9]+ \(file\):
  Error evaluating generator expression:

    \$\<TARGET_INTERMEDIATE_DIR:foo\>

  The evaluation of the TARGET_INTERMEDIATE_DIR generator expression is only
  suitable for consumption by CMake \(limited under Xcode with multiple
  architectures\)\.  It is not suitable for writing out elsewhere\.
