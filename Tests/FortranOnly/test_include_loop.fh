!     CMake Fortran parser does not understand the `#if !defined(...)`
!     syntax, so it does not guard against recursive inclusion. Unless
!     the parser keeps track of already visited files, this leads to
!     processing of around 2^N files, where N is the maximal number of
!     open files. Because N is typically of the order of 1000, without
!     bookkeeping this test hangs.

#if !defined(test_include_loop_fh)
#define test_include_loop_fh

#include "test_include_loop.fh"
#include "test_include_loop.fh"

#endif
