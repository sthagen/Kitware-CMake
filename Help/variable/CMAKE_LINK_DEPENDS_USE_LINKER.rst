CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_USE_LINKER
-----------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.27

For the :ref:`Makefile <Makefile Generators>` and
:ref:`Ninja <Ninja Generators>` generators, link dependencies are now, for a
selection of linkers, generated by the linker itself. By defining this
variable with value ``FALSE``, you can deactivate this feature.

This feature is also deactivated if the :prop_tgt:`LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED`
target property is true.
