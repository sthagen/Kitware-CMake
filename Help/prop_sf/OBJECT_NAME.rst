OBJECT_NAME
-----------

.. versionadded:: 4.2

Set the object name (without the object extension) of the source file. An
empty string value disables custom object naming. The value must be a relative
path, and may not include special directory components (e.g., ``..``).

Note that the object name may not be used as-is in
:variable:`CMAKE_INTERMEDIATE_DIR_STRATEGY` and
:prop_tgt:`INSTALL_OBJECT_NAME_STRATEGY` strategies, but instead changed as
the strategy requires to fulfill its goals.

When installing objects, the :prop_sf:`INSTALL_OBJECT_NAME` property takes
precedence.

This property supports
:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`, but does not
allow for context-sensitive (i.e., configuration-dependent) expressions.

.. note::
   No collision resistance within a target is performed by CMake. When using
   this property, collisions must be avoided in the project code. CMake has a
   number of source files it generates that also create object files that may
   collide with a given custom name. These include:
   * Generated PCH source files (``cmake_pch``)
   * Generated Unity compilation files (``unity_``)
   * Qt autogen sources (``moc_compilations.cpp``)

.. note::
   The :generator:`FASTBuild` and :generator:`Xcode` generators do not support
   this property and it is ignored.
