ctest-runtime-files
-------------------

* :manual:`ctest(1)` learned to recognize files attached to a test at run time.
  Previously it was only possible to attach files to tests at configure time
  by using the :prop_test:`ATTACHED_FILES` or
  :prop_test:`ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL` test properties.
  See :ref:`Additional Test Measurements` for more information.
