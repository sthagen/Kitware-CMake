Genex-LINK_GROUP
----------------

* The :genex:`LINK_GROUP` generator expression was added to manage the grouping
  of libraries during the link step. The variables
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_GROUP_USING_<FEATURE>` and
  :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_GROUP_USING_<FEATURE>` are used to define features
  usable by the :genex:`LINK_GROUP` generator expression.
