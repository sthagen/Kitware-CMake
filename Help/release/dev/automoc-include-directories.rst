automoc-include-directories
---------------------------

* The :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target property and associated
  :variable:`CMAKE_AUTOMOC_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` variable were added to
  override the automatic discovery of moc includes from a target's transitive
  include directories.
