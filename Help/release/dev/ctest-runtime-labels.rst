ctest-runtime-labels
--------------------

* :manual:`ctest(1)` learned to recognize labels attached to a test at run time.
  Previously it was only possible to attach labels to tests at configure time
  by using the :prop_test:`LABELS` test property.
  See :ref:`Additional Test Measurements` for more information.
