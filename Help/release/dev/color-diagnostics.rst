color-diagnostics
-----------------

* The :variable:`CMAKE_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS` variable was added to control
  color diagnostics generated by compilers.  This variable also controls
  color buildsystem messages with :ref:`Makefile Generators`, replacing
  :variable:`CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE`.

  The :envvar:`CMAKE_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS` environment was added to set
  a default value for :variable:`CMAKE_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS`.
