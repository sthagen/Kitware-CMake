.. versionadded:: 4.2

PDB file names always include their target's per-config POSTFIX.

Program database files (``.pdb``) are always named with their target's
:prop_tgt:`DEBUG_POSTFIX` or :prop_tgt:`<CONFIG>_POSTFIX` target property
value.

If the :prop_tgt:`PDB_NAME` target property is defined, CMake 4.1 and below
exclude the target's per-config postfix from the program data base file name.
Otherwise, the per-config postfix is included.  This is inconsistent.
CMake 4.2 and above prefer to always name the program database file with the
per-config postfix regardless how the name is computed, i.e., using
:prop_tgt:`OUTPUT_NAME`, or :prop_tgt:`PDB_NAME`, or neither.  This policy
provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated to account
for the new behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy does not use the per-config postfix in
``.pdb`` file names if the :prop_tgt:`PDB_NAME` target property is defined.
The ``NEW`` behavior always uses the per-config postfix in ``.pdb`` file
names.
