.. versionadded:: 4.2

``Python::NumPy`` does not depend on ``Python::Development.Module``.

:module:`FindPython3`, :module:`FindPython2`, and :module:`FindPython` provide
``Python{3,2,}::NumPy`` and ``Python{3,2,}::Development.Module`` targets when
the corresponding components are requested.

In CMake 4.1 and below, requesting the ``NumPy`` component implies the
``Development.Module`` component, and the provided ``Python{3,2,}::NumPy``
targets depend on the provided ``Python{3,2,}::Development.Module`` targets.
This dependency is not necessary.
In CMake 4.2 and above, requesting the ``NumPy`` component does not imply the
``Development.Module`` component, and the provided ``Python{3,2,}::NumPy``
targets do not depend on the provided ``Python{3,2,}::Development.Module``
targets.
This policy provides compatibility with projects that expect the legacy
behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy makes ``NumPy`` depend on
``Development.Module``.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy does not.
