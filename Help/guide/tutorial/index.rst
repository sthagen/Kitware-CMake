CMake Tutorial
**************

Introduction
============

The CMake tutorial provides a step-by-step guide that covers common build
system issues that CMake helps address. Seeing how various topics all
work together in an example project can be very helpful.

Steps
=====

The tutorial documentation and source code examples can be found in
the ``Help/guide/tutorial`` directory of the CMake source code tree.
Each step has its own subdirectory containing code that may be used as a
starting point. The tutorial examples are progressive so that each step
provides the complete solution for the previous step.
